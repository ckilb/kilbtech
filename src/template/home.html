                With over <strong>20 years of experience</strong> in software development and E-Commerce, I have acquired a wealth of knowledge in technologies, strategies and leadership, which I have the opportunity to demonstrate on a daily basis under high motivation.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-8">
                I have a great intrinsic motivation to fundamentally understand technical concepts and tools in order to use them in a meaningful and goal-oriented way to solve problems.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-8">
                I always try to understand how systems work as a whole. This is the only way to implement complex projects in a goal-oriented way. It is my personal ambition to always be among the best in my field.
            </p>

            <p>
                It gives me great pleasure to pass on my knowledge and at the same time to gain new insights and learn efficient approaches through the exchange with colleagues and friends.
