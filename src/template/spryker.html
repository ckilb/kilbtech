                My name is <strong>Christian Kilb</strong> and I have <strong>over 20 years of experience</strong> in web development.<br />
                Since January 2017 I have been supporting my customers in programming with the Spryker Commerce OS in the enterprise environment as a <strong>technical lead</strong>, <strong>lead</strong> and <strong>senior developer</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3 md:mb-8">
                My experience in Spryker is very advanced and I am often considered a <strong>top performer</strong>.<br />
                I have already helped Spryker themselves and my customers to <strong>fix critical security vulnerabilities</strong> and <strong>make performance optimizations</strong>.
                <br />
                <strong>Clean architecture</strong> and <strong>code quality</strong> is very important to me.<br />
                I attach great importance to clean programming paradigms, including the preference for composition over inheritance in order to ensure that Spryker can be updated over the long term.
                It is important to me to pass on my experience and knowledge to my colleagues so that we can work efficiently and cleanly together as a team
